<h3>Introduction of the organization :</h3>

The Co-operation Directorate is headed by the Registrar of Co-operative Societies, West Bengal, who is a senior officer drawn from the IAS Cadre of the State.</p>
 
<p>The primary objective of the Co-operation Directorate is to see that genuine co-operatives are organized and managed on sound lines as per the basic principles of co-operation for the promotion of the economic interests and welfare of the people and to render guidance and assistance for the development of Co-operative movement in the State.</p>
 
<p>The Directorate has its Headquarters at the New Secretariat Buildings at 1, Kiran Sankar Roy Road, Kolkata - 700001 and the field operations are supervised and controlled by the Deputy/Assistant RCS of the Ranges with offices mainly at the District Head Quarters.

<h3>Future </h3>
<p>Vision and mission of the Co-operation Directorate is to percolate the benefits of the Co-operative Movement to the entire population of the State.</p>
 
<p>It is the policy of the Government to cover all mouzas in the entire rural area of the State by functioning Primary Agricultural Credit Co-operative Societies(PACS) through â€˜Re-organization/Revival of PACSâ€™ so as to provide agricultural credit and allied services at the doorstep of each and every farmers.</p>
 
 
<p>In the coming years, priority will be given towards creation of rural infrastructure through grass-root level co-operative societies for boosting up agricultural growth and value addition. Such infrastructure shall include Storage Godown, Cold Storages, Seed Villages with Seed Grading Units, Custom Hiring Centre for farm mechanisation, Rural Haat, Processing Units, etc.</p>
 
<p>The Co-operation Directorate is committed to inculcate professionalism and skill development amongst the management and employees of the Co-operative Societies by way of Training for policy growth and good governance and at the same time awareness creation for increase in membership coverage as well as to encourage in business diversification.</p>
 
<p>Empowerment of women through formation of SHGs and Women Co-operatives is another thrust area in the days ahead.</p>
 
<p>Initiative has already been taken to construct â€˜Samabay Bhavanâ€™ in all Ranges to bring all offices related to Co-operation Department under one roof. Samabay Bhavan has already been completed in Burdwan-I, Burdwan-III, North 24-Pgs. and almost completed in Paschim Medinipur and Purulia Ranges.
